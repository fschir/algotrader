# Models used

## Objectives 

Figure out which model fits best. 

### Current Models:

* DQN A2C - Deep Q learning Advantage Actor Critic (Needs more research) 
* Simple reinforcement learning. 

#### Simple Rl things to implement

* Episolon Greedy vs Optimistic
* Bayesian/thompson Sampling
* Rewards -> Implement in Environment
* Markov Decision Bellmann
* Mont Carlo & Temp Difference
* Approximation and shit
